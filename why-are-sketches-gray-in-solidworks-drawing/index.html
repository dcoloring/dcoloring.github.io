I&#39;ve attached the screen shot below of your model please check if this is the problem you are looking to get solved. Almost always, these dimensions will come in black. When doing the 3d i did some sketches and used revolving cuts but now when doing the drawings the sketches i did are now showing in thin grey lines. You may also expand color properties and use the sliders, or key in rgb values to create a custom color.
