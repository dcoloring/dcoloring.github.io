ultraMARIN Sketches from daily routine From marinagrechanik.blogspot.com
In spite of the freezing cold, i did a second sketch of the amazing #fisherhouse (see last post). The local bandstand back in action after many many months silence, a cafe view in kingsmead. The idea is to mix it up — to do some sketches at home and others when i’m out and about. I was so exciting to be there, after sketching it with my students (by reference pictures and plans) so many times!
